Used some [python scripts](https://github.com/mikewesthad/EverythingAddedToFood_Database) I had written to generate food labels. Uses the "Everything Added to Food in the United States" database to fill a texture with random FDA-approved food additives.

Explanation of liquid code. 
- Loop through the array of imagenames in the front matter. 
  - Build an image path from the front matter variables. 
  - Load that image path and make it a link, so that clicking takes you to a full resolution image.

{% for imagename in page.imagenames %}
{% capture imagepath %}{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ page.sketchpath }}/{{ imagename }}{% endcapture %}
[![{{ imagename }}]({{ imagepath }})]({{ imagepath}})
{% endfor %}
