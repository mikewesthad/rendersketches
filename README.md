I'm a fan of Ryan Green's render sketch game, gesture drawing for 3D modeling:

> Hey Twitter, let's play a game. Rules: 10 min timer. 3d Tool. Start with Cube and Plane. Make something pretty. [#RenderSketchGame](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23RenderSketchGame&amp;src=hash) 

> Post your source, remix, share.
