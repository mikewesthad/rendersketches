# rendersketchgame #

I'm a fan of Ryan Green's render sketch game, gesture drawing for 3D modeling:

First attempt at #rendersketchgame.  The "intended" render sandwiched between two accidents:

This one I forgot to time.  It ran a bit over and is "cheating" since it used some [python scripts](https://github.com/mikewesthad/Extract_EverythingAddedToFood_Database) I had written to generate food labels.  Uses the "Everything Added to Food in the United States" database to fill a texture with random FDA-approved food additives.
